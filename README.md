## Features

- **Interactive Fruit Selection**: Players can choose their favorite fruit from a set of fruit images. The UI visually highlights the selected fruit to enhance user experience.
- **Randomized Spin Mechanics**: On clicking the spin button, the fruit symbols alternate rapidly before landing on a random result.
- **Win/Lose Feedback**: Players receive instant feedback after each spin. If the selected fruit matches the result, they win; otherwise, they lose. The game features playful win/loss sounds for added excitement.
- **Custom Background Music**: Background music can be toggled on or off, providing an immersive experience for the player.

## How to Play

1. **Pick your fruit** from the selection grid.
2. Press the **green spin button** to start the game.
3. Watch the fruits spin in the middle of the screen.
4. If your chosen fruit matches the final spin, you win! Otherwise, try your luck again.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the game interface and ensuring semantic markup.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game elements and providing smooth animations and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The game logic, including fruit rotation, event handling, randomization, and state management, is implemented in pure JavaScript.
- **Font Awesome**: For implementing dynamic sound control buttons (volume on/off).
- **Media Queries**: To enhance the game layout for desktop and mobile devices, although further optimizations for mobile and tablet views are planned.

## Project Highlights

- **Event-driven programming**: Demonstrates proficiency in handling user interaction (clicks, selections) and triggering appropriate UI updates and game logic.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Uses `XMLHttpRequest` to dynamically load the fruit data from a JSON file, showcasing understanding of asynchronous data loading.
- **Animations and Transitions**: Implements smooth CSS animations for the fruit spin effect, as well as fading transitions for enhanced visuals.
- **Audio Control**: Includes background music control with toggling options, using JavaScript to manage media states (play, pause).
